# VenGrow - Real Estate Marketplace India

## Overview

VenGrow is a comprehensive real estate marketplace platform tailored for the Indian market. It facilitates connections between property buyers, sellers, and brokers by offering robust property listings, advanced search functionalities, inquiry management, and streamlined transaction processes. The platform emphasizes verified sellers, package-based listing subscriptions, and role-based dashboards, aspiring to become a leading solution in the Indian real estate sector. Key capabilities include managing property listings, facilitating buyer-seller interactions, and providing administrative tools for platform oversight.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend

The frontend is built with React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Wouter for routing, and TanStack Query for server state. It uses shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS for a mobile-first, responsive design. State management leverages React Query and react-hook-form with Zod. The design system employs custom CSS variables for theming, component composition, and custom hooks, ensuring consistent UI and role-based rendering.

### Backend

The backend utilizes Node.js and Express.js with TypeScript, featuring a RESTful API design. It's built with an abstracted storage interface, currently in-memory, but designed for future integration with Drizzle ORM and PostgreSQL.

### Data Storage

PostgreSQL, hosted on Neon serverless, is the primary database, managed by Drizzle ORM for type-safe queries and migrations. The schema is defined in shared files, using UUIDs for primary keys, with Drizzle Kit handling migrations.

### Authentication & Authorization

The platform features a multi-role authentication system supporting Google OAuth and email/password logins for users, and separate admin authentication. User registration is intent-based (buyer or seller), with granular seller types (Individual, Broker, Corporate). Session management uses Express-session with a PostgreSQL store. Role-based access control is implemented both client-side (ProtectedRoute) and server-side.

### Core Features & Workflows

-   **Property Approval Workflow**: Properties progress through states like draft, submitted, under_review, approved, and rejected, managed by an admin moderation queue.
-   **Package & Subscription System**: Tiered subscription packages (Free, Basic, Premium, Enterprise) dictate listing limits, integrated with Razorpay for payments and automatic subscription creation.
-   **Design System & Theming**: A CSS custom property-based color system provides semantic tokens and automatic dark mode. Accessibility is ensured via Radix UI primitives.
-   **Interactive Maps**: Google Maps API (@react-google-maps/api) is used for various map components, including property views, detail pages, and location selection, with Google Places Autocomplete.
-   **Verified Builders Section**: A homepage section highlights corporate builders, linking to their filtered listings.
-   **Transaction Types**: Supports Buy (Sale), Lease, and Rent, consistently displayed across the UI.
-   **Property Categorization**: A hierarchical system with 11 main categories and 63 subcategories, including project stage filters for relevant categories.
-   **Location Standardization**: Uses standardized dropdowns for Indian states, cities, and PIN codes, enhancing data consistency.
-   **Enhanced FilterSidebar**: Advanced filtering options including transaction type, location, property category/subcategory, project stage, property age, builder search, and seller type.
-   **Seller Dashboard**: Includes an ApprovalStatusTracker for property workflow visualization and management, with lead and appointment management planned.
-   **Property Listing Details**: Captures Possession Status, New Construction, Furnishing Status, and Property Age.
-   **Admin CMS**: A reusable AdminDataTable component powers content management for various platform entities.
-   **Routing**: Client-side routing with Wouter for public, authenticated, and administrative routes, including sticky header, mobile menu, and breadcrumbs.
